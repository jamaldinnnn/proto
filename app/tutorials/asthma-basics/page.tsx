                What is Asthma?
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide, from young
                  children to adults. Think of your airways as branches in a tree ‚Äì in asthma, these branches become
                  inflamed and narrow, making breathing more challenging.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When someone has asthma, their airways are more sensitive and reactive to various environmental
                  triggers. This sensitivity causes three main changes in the airways:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>The airway walls become swollen and inflamed</li>
                  <li>Muscles around the airways tighten (bronchospasm)</li>
                  <li>Extra mucus is produced, further narrowing the air passages</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold">üî¨ Inside Your Airways:</p>
                <p>
                  During an asthma episode, the airways undergo significant changes that can make breathing difficult.
                  The combination of inflammation, muscle tightening, and mucus production creates the classic symptoms
                  that asthma patients experience.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold">‚öïÔ∏è Important to Know:</p>
                <p>
                  While asthma cannot be cured, it can be effectively managed with proper medical care and lifestyle
                  adjustments. Many people with asthma lead active, healthy lives by understanding their condition and
                  following their treatment plan.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold">üéØ Impact on Daily Life:</p>
                <p>
                  Asthma symptoms can vary from mild to severe and may change over time. Some people experience symptoms
                  only occasionally, while others might have more frequent episodes. Understanding your personal asthma
                  pattern is key to effective management.
                </p>

                  <li>Over 300 million people worldwide live with asthma</li>
                  <li>Asthma often runs in families</li>

                  Understanding asthma is the first step toward effective management. As you continue through this
                  learning module, you'll discover more about triggers, symptoms, and treatment strategies that can help
                  you or your patients better control this condition.
